# api-imdb

Hey guys. 

I decided to create an example-template for API connections.

It can take requests and pass on requests as well.

obviously it is D most simple thing to set up, but I just wanted a ready template for example instead of 

setting it up every time from the begining.

and I said .. why not making it public? :D
